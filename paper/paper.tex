0.5 inch (12 mm) below the title area and no more than 3.125 inches (80 mm) in
length.  Leave a 0.5 inch (12 mm) space between the end of the abstract and the
beginning of the main text.  The abstract should contain about 100 to 150
words, and should be identical to the abstract text submitted electronically

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This is a good paper. 

\section{CNN-CNN Autoencoder} 
The approximation $\hat X$ for a given spectrogram $X$ is computed as follows: 

\begin{align}
	\hat H(k,t) =& ( \sum_{f,t'} X(f,t-t') F_e(f,t',k) ) \notag \\
	\hat X(f,t) =& \sum_k \sum_{t'} \hat H(k,t-t') F_d(f, t',k)
\end{align}

\section{RNN-CNN Autoencoder}
This is the same as CNN-CNN case, except the computation of the activations $H$. In the CNN encoder, each filter was of finite length. With RNN-CNN version, we are attempting to use an infinite length filter. The computation of $\hat H$ is as follows: 

\begin{align}
	Z(:,k,t) =& \sigma( W Z(:,k,t-1) + U X(:,t)) \notag \\
	\hat H(k,t) =& \sum_f Z(f,k,t)
\end{align}


\section{REFERENCES}
\label{sec:ref}

List and number all bibliographical references at the end of the paper.  The references can be numbered in alphabetic order or in order of appearance in the document.  When referring to them in the text, type the corresponding reference number in square brackets as shown at the end of this sentence \cite{C2}.

% References should be produced using the bibtex program from suitable
% BiBTeX files (here: strings, refs, manuals). The IEEEbib.bst bibliography
% style file from IEEE produces unsorted bibliography list.
